<h1 align="center">RIDGEFIELD FITNESS</h1>

[View the live project here.](http://)

My focus is to create a easy to navigate site with clear signposting of links and pages. I want customers to be able to quickly find prices for membership, easily find out where the Gym is located, and the times the gym is open. I also want customers to be able to find this information using one click on my website, and not be required to contact the gym by phone or email to have these questions answered.

I am looking for my site to be of value to the customer as it should answer all of their questions by them easily navigating between a few linked pages on the site, and to help them establish whether they would like to try out the gym for free or sign up as a member.
The site should also help to show prospective customers the offers and facilities at the Gym, and helping to obtain new business, and to retain existing customer by providing relivant and clear updates regarding the gym and also access to their Online Account.

My motivation for creating this site is to try and make it easy and very accesable for prospective customers and members to find out information about where the gym is, how much they charge and where to find them. I want to be able to show off the features they have on offer in the gym, and make it sound and look like an appealing venue.
I want to make navigating the site easy and to make sure the informaion is not cluttered and there is value its content.

The gym is an independant local gym, so I want to try and make it look like a great place to join and become a member of. I am looking to add several photos in a slide show which would showcase the staff helping members, the classes happening at the gym, and the types of equipment and facilities available.

I want my site to stand out for its simple layout, but its ease to navigate and find out relivant information needed. I want my site to stand out for its great colour use, and I want to be able to use neon motivting headings with a darker background and boxes, to give my site an 90's type of feel.


## User Experience (UX)

- ### First time visitor goals

1. As a first time visitor to my site, I want them to enjoy the colour scheme and layout of my Home page and pages. I want them to be able to look at my Home page and instantly know what to press or where to scroll to find out the basics they may want to know, such as the Opening Hours, a Map of where to find us, and our Membership prices.
2. I want them to be able to navigate the site to then find out any further information such as the types of classes the gym offers and the dates and times. Also I want them to be able to follow the link to Our Gym and find out the information about who started the gym and what facilities and equipment they have on offer there.
3. I want the visitor to feel as though it is a modern, responsive and professional looking website, and have confidence in the information I am putting out.

- ### Returning visitor goals

1. As a returning visitor or a member, I want them to be able to to log-in to their account easily and find where this is on the site. I also want them to be able to find and know where the Timetable page is, and that it is easy to read and informative for returning visitors.
2. I want returning visitors to easily be able to find the contact information if they needed to speak to the gym re an issue with left belongings at the gym, or if they want to contact their PT.
3. I am looking for returning visitors get obtain any information they need during their returning visit to the site, that they may not have been looking for on their first visit. This could be access to the gyms Instagram page or Facebook page, so they can look at photos and also perhaps upload their own to the site.

- ### Frequent visitor goals

1. As a frequent visitor I want customers  to keep coming back to relivant interesting information, or upto date news on the club like opening hours over the Christmas Holidays for example, where they would find information easily. 
2. I would like there to be a 'review' page, where visiting customers or members can leave a review and optional photos of their visit to the gym. This is something I have as a plan-B however, and maybe will get the site created and running to add this at a later date.

- ### Target audiance

1. The target audiance would probably be anyone who is considering working out for the first time, and who wants to see if there is a gym close to them with the right facilities for them, or who maybe wants to see if they offer PT support if they joined.
2. There would be customers who are regular exercisers and who want to try out or change to a new gym with new equipment. A customer who probably looks straight at the gym equipment and the classes timetable first when visiting the site.
3. I believe age wise it may be very varied, as the age of members could be from 17 with no upper age limit, and a lot of the classes and equipment may appeal to older retired people who are looking to stay fit and healthy.
4. If the gym is located around offices then I can imagine office or shop workers may find it convenient to pop by the gym after work before heading home, so customer who want to see what classes are on during their lunch break or after 5pm would probably make up quite a few numbers to the site.
5. I feel that prospective customer may make more of an emotional purchase with us through the site, rather than just focussing on the prices or by impulse. If people are looking on the site and they see motivating photos of people working out, men or women getting fit and healthy and looking toned, it could make people feel more motivated to join up and take a first step in getting them selves in that shape as well, and it could help to create an emotional response that could lend itself to signing up and starting the journey they are imagining.



## Features

- ### Functional specifications

1. New ideas for a future release would be to include more of a members and visitors page, where there is a board of photos that can be posted from the customers and also staff. There would also be a board where you can leave a comment or review of staff or the gym.
2. I would also consider having the membership buttons to straight to a new page, where the options for membership is written over a whole page. Although at the moment as I dont think there is too much clutter or information on the Home page, it may look a bit bare if I just had 'Click here for a FREE day pass' as a box content.
3. I am looking to include 4 page links on my Home page. These are the 'Home' page which would bring you back to the main page. There will be a 'Timetable' page which would take you to a Monday-Friday timetable text box with smaller boxes of the classes title and time info. There will be a page called 'Our Club' which would tell you a small paragraph of information regarding who runs the gym and when they first started. Half way down this page there would be a heading of 'Facilities and Equipment' where customer can look up the types of equipment they have and whether they have a studio room or pool etc. The last page is the 'Sign-In' page, which would take them to a page where at the top there is the option to log-in as a member, or sign-up and create an account.
4. The main lay out boxes are repeated through the website, and the main image remains at the same height and lengh throughout. I am also hoping to create a sliding photo gallery on the Home page of the website that includes several photos of inside the gym itself, so customers get to see what it is like inside the gym.
5. I am going to include two links in the bottom right of the page for Instagram and Facebook.

- ### Content requirements

1. Regarding content on the site, I am looking to make all content relivant and specific to customers wanting to know more about the gym and how to join or try out the gym. I am going to include a Map at the bottom of the page, with the opening times and also the contact information such as email, phone and address on either side of the map at the bottom of the page.
2. Content for the membership options will be very easy to read and find, and there will be 3 options to choose from, these will be a Free day pass, an Off peak membership, or an All access membership. As this is going to be a local family run gym, there would only be a couple of easy to manage membership types.
3. In the top left of the Home page there is the gyms logo and the club name next to it.
4. The content on the 'Our Gym' page will be including a bullet point list of equipment items and weight types, and also the facilities would be in a list so customers can easily look down these to see if they have what they are looking for at the gym.
5. The Sign-In page would include simple information the customer is looking for, as they are either looking to easily log in or create an account. It would have the easy to read sign posting of where to do this in the middle of the box on the page.


- ### Interaction design

1. I am looking to create a Nav bar in the top right of my site, as this tends to be where people expect it to be. Also I will be making this Nav bar with the Home page first, Timetable second as I think this is a main page that new or frequent users would access. The Our club page is next as new users would be looking to find out what is at the gym when deciding whether or not to join. the Sign-in page is next as exisiting members probably expect this to be in the corner right, as a lot of other websites have this in the corner. The same nav bar and order would sppear on every page of the site.
2. I am also going to make the Logo of the site in the top left corner. This will catch peoples eye as soon as the site loads, and tells them they are on the right page. I am also going to link the Logo into returning back to the Home page, as this also tends to be the norm with a lot of other websites.
3. Colour scheme is going to be the same throughout, this is going to be a muted grey or dark background, with lighter coloured boxes and then white or neon coloured headings or touches with give a pop of colour and reflection off of some of the boxes.
4. The layout on the Home page will be three boxes going horizontaly across the middle of the page, with the photo above and three other boxes of the same size directly below with the Opening times, map and contact info. I am looking for the boxes to still look different enough though, as they will have icons inside them next to the writting, the map will also break up these a little as it wouldnt have a box border like the others. There would be three 'join now' buttons to break up the look of the six boxes together as well, so I think it is enough to make it look neat and eact to look at, but not looking like idential boxes.


- ### Information architecture

1. I am using the 'Hub and Spoke' layout for my site, as there will be 4 seperate pages with no other onpage links that would take you into another page not included on the nav bar.
2. Priority one - Membership information and easy to read options and price.
3. Priority two - Finding the Opening times, Map and Contact information easily and on the Home page.
4. Priority three - Large photo on each page spreading lengh ways to the corners of the page.

## Changes made and bug fixes
Input col-xs and col-sm. I had created the site using float and width for my colours, I ran into a few problems with doing this as I am then having to add many media breaks due to my site when the screen is below a certain screen, especially when I get down to mobile phone size. I had started to use a grid before I had written any code for this project, however at that time I didn’t understand it well enough to implement this from the beginning. However after looking on W3 Schools, I came across the Bootstrap grid again and realised this would help in my horizontal boxes. 
I had a few issues with my images being too big for my screen, and when viewing on a wide screen the img would take up the majority of the screen. I managed to get around this by adding a max-height to the main images and carousel, and also adding an ‘object-fit’ so it may end up cutting a little of the photo off for extra large screen sizes, but would fit correctly at normal laptop sizes, tablet and mobile. I will also try and get the large screen image to appear correctly also.
 Contact-us box. I have an img on the left and a comment box on the right, however the img despite adding a max-height and ‘object-fit’, I could not seem to get the img to not shrink down lower than the comment box when downsized, so there had been a gap at the bottom of the image until it hit an XS size and went into 100% width ********How did I solve this???
Carousel img - I had issues with the carousel as firstly the images were only showing with a height of 300px, I helped this by adding a max height onto the images, so the carousel expands to 600px height and then the images were set to ‘overflow-hidden’


- #### GALLERY PAGE
Correction to wireframe!!! I had set on my wireframes to do a membership page, with a sign up box and a free day pass page. When I had created the sign in and create account page to mirror the same look and design as the sign in page, I realised that the membership page was best used instead to portray more images of the gym and people using it, as the only other images used were in the carousel where people could see what it was like at the gym. I also thought that as it is a simple sign up for the free pass and the one membership on offer, that I would ask members to ‘create an account’ in order to be able to purchase and sign up for the free pass.


- #### MAIN PAGE
Correction to wireframe!!! On my main page, I realised that combining the ‘equipment and facilities’ box together and having the map next to it did not work. It made the map appear too small when the screen size was reduced, and did not look very clear. I changed this by moving the map down below and making it 100% width. I then separated the equipment and facilities into two boxes and floated these next to each other
I started by using a template on W3Schools which helped give me some guidance on creating boxes and floating them. I did not keep the layout and the majority of the code, however I did use some of the class names. I found this helped me to see how horizontal boxes float to the left, and to image how my boxes may look on my website.
I decided to add a ‘container’ around the body of all of my pages as I had originally wanted padding on the left and right margins, however I ran into difficulty with when the sizes moved down to iPad and mobile phone sizes, as the margins did not line up and made different size gaps. I had read that you can counter-act this with margin 0, however I then found that container automatically added a large margin around the content, and also centred the body of my page which I really like the effect and also that my images and carousel appear very clear. I have decided to add the container after the heading and nav bar, so this
adds to an affect of the heading stretching with the ‘vw’ of my heading, and it frames the page really well.
 Change to colour of membership sign in boxes and hours and contact information. This is due to running it through the Chrome developer ‘Lighthouse’ and it had given me guidance that the background and foreground colours were not clear enough. I also changed the text colour on all ‘buttons’ from white to black to help make this stand out more. 
I started by having my opening hours box written with paragraph and line breaks, however I changed this to UL and li when I realised that it was not the right way to use paragraphs. I then had an issue with the opening hours box effecting my ul on my timetable page, so had to make sure I separated them with different id’s.
I originally had an image places under my header, however this was placed there to be replaced with a carousel. I found this on Bootstrap after a few weeks and implemented this on my main page. 


- #### SIGN IN PAGE
Correction to wireframe!!! When creating the boxes for my sign-in and create account page, I ended up stacking them on top of each other instead of in two columns. I did this because I had originally planned on having some information underneath the ‘sign-in’ box which would mean it would then be the same height as the ‘create account’ box, as it was quite a lot shorter. I changed this from my original plan as I found the writing did not flow as planned when placed under the sign in box, and also it had resulted in the ‘create account’ box to look quite bare. I changed this to merge the membership page into the same page, and list some information for people to learn that they have to ‘create an account’ to redeem a free pass or sign up as a member. I feel it looks cleaner and flows better on the page.


- #### TIMETABLE PAGE
I had started by adding 8 images under the timetable box, however tI thought this looked quite crowded, and also on smaller screens the photos would scroll for quite a while to get through them. I felt as though 4 was a good number, and it gave me more than enough space to include all of the information about what different classes were.

- #### ISSUES
My code passed the W3 Validation, however the Chrome Lighthouse scanning marks me down for these of images which are not the appropriate size. I have used Photoshop to re-size all of my photos, however it changes the width and auto corrects the hight itself, so I could only have the width be correct on their scan and not height.
Regarding the colours of my site, I had planned on a darker version of my current colours, however when running it through Chrome Lighthouse it warned of hard to read text on the boxes I had the darker colour, and also my header was quite dark for my header and paragraph to show up. I looked online to find the best colours that would go together and corrected this throughout my site.
I felt I used quite a few media breaks (and maybe needed even more) when there could have been an easier way of doing this by starting with a flex grid or a guide on Bootstrap which would help add the media breaks evenly throughout my site. I looked into them at the very start, however I did not feel confident to implement these at the time of first starting.
A main error I made at the very beginning was making a few large commits. I had looked through the assessment information a while before I started, but I did not remember to take this on board and the reasons whyit was important to do this. For the first month of my project I felt as though I made quite a few changed to my original wireframe or plan, this is because I did not anticipate being able to create more than a few basic boxes, so I had made my wireframes very basic and tried to get in all the information I could into them. During that month I felt as though I had gone through lots of different options such as a grid template, and a Bootstrap template, however then decided it did not work for me when starting out, so I did not ‘commit’ any of these changes as I had incorrectly thought that commits were when you made changes that you had finished and were keeping in place, so I realised then after reading the assessment again, that it was written down as required to prove that you had not plagiarised. I mentioned to my 
monitor about this mistake, and also have made sure I commit a lot more since then also.
A warning that shows on W3C validator is ‘section does not have heading’ however I have input both id and class into section headings, however they are still showing up that the section should have a header, or else to use a div (but in our classes they advise to use sections, so I have kept these in)
